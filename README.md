# Trubbish Collector
 A web-based game app done for a class project.

 Created primarily to experiment with using Javascript to create a functional game on an HTML canvas element. Instructions are shown on the web page; click the canvas element to begin, then use the arrow keys to move the character around the screen. This is a high-score based game where the objective is to collect as many Trubbish (the garbage bag creatures) as you can before touching four Yungoos (the snarling mammals). As the player collects more Trubbish they increase in size, making it harder to avoid the enemies.

 This project uses basic HTML to display the elements on the screen, CSS to position the elements properly, and Javascript to code the functionality of the game itself. In addition, the project uses service workers to cache application data and in theory make it accessible offline, as well as Dexie to store a player's previous high scores.

 This project was created as part of the curriculum for CS 294, Web App Development, during the fall 2022 semester at the University of Illinois at Chicago. All images used in the project are taken from the game "Pokemon Shuffle" and are owned by Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. Template code provided by Replit, Dexie, and David Hayes.
